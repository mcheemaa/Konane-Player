# Konane-Player
Also known as Hawaiian checkers, konane is a strategy game played between two players. Players alternate taking turns, capturing their opponent’s pieces by jumping their own pieces over them (if you’re familiar with checkers, there is a strong structural analogy to be made here). The first player to be unable to capture any of their opponent’s pieces loses.
